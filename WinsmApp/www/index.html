    Recommended JavaScript library load order for hybrid Cordova apps:

    * "Device-Independent" JavaScript libraries.
    * optional: weinre debug script tag for remote console debug (see notes).
    * Intel XDK device JavaScript library.
    * Cordova/PhoneGap device JavaScript library.
    * "Device-Dependent" JavaScript libraries.
    * Application JavaScript <script> tags and libraries.
    * optional: weinre debug script tag for remote console debug (see notes).

    In complex projects, the JavaScript load order is important. You must
    insure that the underlying device API native code finishes its init, which
    usually takes longer than the webview init...

    VERY IMPORTANT: notice that all of the libraries used in this project are
    located within the app's local directories, which means they will get
    bundled with the app. They are NOT being pulled in over the net. In most
    cases, this is what you should be doing when you build a hybrid mobile
    app. This insures that you always use the JS code that you debugged
    against AND that you are not requiring a data connection (network
    connection) to get the app started. If your app startup required a data
    connection to initialize and start interaction with the user, lack of a
    reliable network connection could be disasterous. Not to mention it
    generally results in a slower load time. Loading locally is much
    friendlier to your end user's data plan and their device battery.  :-)

    NOTE: do not use a directory prefix with the cordova.js file - it is
    inserted automatically by the build system, simulator and other tools and
    is assumed to be in the index.html source directory. You will not find
    this JS file anywhere in your project, it is a "phantom" library. If you
    do see copies of this file as part of your project it should be removed to
    avoid confusion and problems.

    LIBRARY NOTE: If you are using a large number of JavaScript libraries,
    especially third-party libraries (like jQuery, {{ mustache }}, Underscore,
    etc.) that are "independent" of the device APIs provided by the Cordova
    library and plugins - and they are independent of your app code - your
    app initialization will be most successful if you load these libraries
    BEFORE the Cordova JS file, in the <head> section of your index.html file.
    Obviously, any code that depends on Cordova APIs must be loaded AFTER the
    cordova.js library.

    Libraries that are "independent" of the device APIs are libraries that you
    could use in a desktop browser. "Dependent" libraries are, most likely,
    your own code that you've written specifically to work with the Cordova
    device APIs. In some cases, if your device-dependent code requires access
    to device-independent code to get started, you may have to use something
    like CommonJS to force the device-dependent code to wait for the
    device-independent code to initialize, otherwise you may have trouble
    getting your app started.

    Because of this added dependency on the underlying native code (device)
    initialization, you should not use the "document ready" event to start
    your application. You should wait for the cordova "deviceready" event
    before you begin your application (if it uses any Cordova device APIs); in
    practice, it is best to wait for both. (See the init-dev.js file in this
    template for an example of how to wait for both, it generates a custom
    "app.Ready" event that you can wait for and just forget about the other
    events.)

    NOTE: *any* library that redefines addEventListener() or fiddles with
    outstanding events may interfere with capturing the Cordova "deviceready"
    event and should, therefore, be placed *BEFORE* the Cordova JS library in
    the load order.

    ALSO: if you use weinre for debugging, you may have to experiment with the
    placement of the weinre script. Some recommended locations are shown
    within this app. If these locations do not work, you may have to
    experiment. The optimum placement can be app-specific, primarily as a
    function of the included JavaScript libraries and your initialization.
